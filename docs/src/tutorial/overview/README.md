# Overview

## Introduction

Welcome to our beginner's tutorial for smart contract developers interested in learning more about the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This tutorial is aimed towards developers who are already familiar with smart contracts and have had some experience programming in a smart contract language such as Solidity or Vyper.

In this tutorial, we'll be covering:

- The basics of the Ethereum Virtual Machine
- "Hello, World" in assembly
- Setting up a Hardhat environment to write, test, and deploy your code
- How to write automated tests using `ethers.js`
- Deploying your contracts to various Ethereum testnets

This tutorial loosely follows the [original Hardhat tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/).

To follow this tutorial you must understand:

- How to write code in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) and [Solidity/Vyper](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/languages/)
- How [smart contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/#:~:text=Smart%20contracts%20are%20a%20type,network%20and%20run%20as%20programmed.) work
- Use [git](https://git-scm.com/doc)
